## 👨‍💻 My Contribution
I contributed to the backend development of the Dream Travellers industry project. My work focused on developing the FastAPI application, implementing API endpoints for user registration, login, password recovery, and AI-powered trip generation. I also handled database integration using SQLAlchemy with SQLite, managed project dependencies, and created a Dockerfile for containerized deployment.

My contribution is visible through GitHub commits on backend-related files such as `app.py`, `Dockerfile`, and `requirements.txt`.
